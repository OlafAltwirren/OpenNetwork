NAME
  stping - check if an interface is reachable
  
SYNOPSIS
  stping [address] [--c= --count=[ping count]] [--s= --size=[data size]]
  [--i= --interval=[seconds]] [--t= --droptime=[seconds]] [--v --verbose]

DESCRIPTION
  stping uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST frame to elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from an interface.
  ECHO_REQUEST frames (''pings'') have a sourceUUID and destinationUUID header, followed by a struct timeval and then
  an arbitrary number of ''pad'' bytes used to fill out the frame.

OPTIONS
  --c= --count=[ping count]
    Amount of pings to send(default 6)

  --s= --size=[data size]
    Payload size(default 56 bytes)

  --i= --interval=[seconds]
    Ping interval(default 1s)

  --t= --droptime=[seconds]
    Amount of time after which ping is Considered to be lost[default 8s]

  --v --verbose
    Output more details

  When using ping for fault isolation, it should first be run on the local interface, to verify that the local network
  interface is up and running. Then, foreign interfaces, that are directly reachable and then bridged ones further and
  further away should be ''pinged''. Round-trip times and frame loss statistics are computed. If duplicate frames are
  received, they are not included in the frame loss calculation, although the round trip time of these frames is used
  in calculating the minimum/average/maximum round-trip time numbers. When the specified number of frames have been
  sent (and received) or if the program is terminated with a SIGINT, a brief summary is displayed. Shorter current
  statistics can be obtained without termination of process with signal SIGQUIT.

  If stping does not receive any reply frames at all it will exit with code 1. If a frame count and deadline are both
  specified, and fewer than count frames are received by the time the deadline has arrived, it will also exit with
  code 1. On other error it exits with code 2. Otherwise it exits with code 0. This makes it possible to use the exit
  code to see if a host is alive or not.

  This program is intended for use in network testing, measurement and management. Because of the load it can impose on
  the network, it is unwise to use ping during normal operations or from automated scripts.

EXAMPLES
  stping 87aadb93-7ef2-42a7-bc09-3c9d17fd2f0f
    Sends 6 ping frames to 87aadb93-7ef2-42a7-bc09-3c9d17fd2f0f

  stping 87aadb93-7ef2-42a7-bc09-3c9d17fd2f0f --c=100 --s=1024 --v
    Sends 100 ping frames to 87aadb93-7ef2-42a7-bc09-3c9d17fd2f0f with the size of each 1024 bytes and prints out
    more verbose data.
